Unfortunately, this step needs experience for you to know what is unusual; therefore I advise that you enter the file names into GTFObins and looking for SUID exploits. After running down the list, you discover that python has a SUID vulnerability, so now you run it on the reverse shell. Once the exploit is complete, I use the whoami command to check it worked usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-p\")' whoami root From here you need to find the root flag by outputting the file in the root users home directory.

Programming Language - to understand exploits, you may need to read code - so understanding at least one programming language is crucial. Additionally, you can then code automated exploits making future jobs easier. Any popular programming language is great to learn and for newbies I recommend python (but it is a matter of preference and using the right language for the job). Background Knowledge - this one really depends on what you wish to hack; but the more you know about your target, the easier your job will be. E.g. if you wish to reverse engineer software, then knowledge of assembly language is needed. Legal Knowledge - as hacking is a border line subject it is best to know what you can and cannot do. As a rule of thumb, you can attack your own devices but never anyone elses without prior permission.
