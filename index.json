Prerequisites As hacking is such a large area, this largely depends on the area you wish to advance your career in, but a good place to start is: Linux Commands - as hacking typically involves using Kali Linux as a virtual machine and you normally have to exploit Linux based commands; you must be confident with the CLI. Programming Language - to understand exploits, you may need to read code - so understanding at least one programming language is crucial. Additionally, you can then code automated exploits making future jobs easier. Any popular programming language is great to learn and for newbies I recommend python (but it is a matter of preference and using the right language for the job). Background Knowledge - this one really depends on what you wish to hack; but the more you know about your target, the easier your job will be. E.g. if you wish to reverse engineer software, then knowledge of assembly language is needed. Legal Knowledge - as hacking is a border line subject it is best to know what you can and cannot do. As a rule of thumb, you can attack your own devices but never anyone elses without prior permission. Starting Hacking As I am a practical learner, I believe the best way to learn is via practicing. A good place to start is by using Try Hack Me and I plan to release walkthroughs to some of the levels.

All activities I complete are legal under UK law (as long as you follow the above paragraph), however I am not a lawyer and hence accept no responsibility for anything you do! Laws may also be different in other countries. Hope to post more soon! Jack ","date":"2021-05-03","objectID":"/welcome/:0:0","tags":["Welcome"],"title":"Welcome","uri":"/welcome/"}]
