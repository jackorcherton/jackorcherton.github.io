I firstly scanned with sV to determine the software versions, however as the target wouldn’t respond to host discovery, I had to disable it using the -Pn option. $ nmap -sV -Pn 10.10.130.205 Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower. Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-05-03 20:08 BST Nmap scan report for 10.10.130.205 Host is up (0.068s latency).

Now I wondered if we could upload a shell and as we know the server runs Apache I grabbed the Pentest Monkey Reverse PHP Shell. Firstly, we setup a netcat listener ready to receive the shell on the attacking machine. $ nc -nvlp 1234 Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat ) Ncat: Listening on :::1234 Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:1234 Next I edited line 49 of the shell to match my attacking machine’s IP address and uploaded it to the website. Once we uploaded the file, we are provided with a success message; it says Veja - which means go. So if you click on the link it will open the file, this will cause the page to freeze. Now we return to the netcat listener and we have received a shell and can find the user flag. Privilege Escalation Now we have found the user flag, we need to escalate our privileges. To do this, I used to find files with a SUID bit. find / -perm /4000 2\u003e/dev/null From that, you need to look at the list and see if there are any unusual files. Unfortunately, this step needs experience for you to know what is unusual; therefore I advise that you enter the file names into GTFObins and looking for SUID exploits. After running down the list, you discover that python has a SUID vulnerability, so now you run it on the reverse shell. Once the exploit is complete, I use the whoami command to check it worked usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-p\")' whoami root From here you need to find the root flag by outputting the file in the root users home directory.

Prerequisites As hacking is such a large area, this largely depends on the area you wish to advance your career in, but a good place to start is: Linux Commands - as hacking typically involves using Kali Linux as a virtual machine and you normally have to exploit Linux based commands; you must be confident with the CLI. Programming Language - to understand exploits, you may need to read code - so understanding at least one programming language is crucial. Additionally, you can then code automated exploits making future jobs easier. Any popular programming language is great to learn and for newbies I recommend python (but it is a matter of preference and using the right language for the job). Background Knowledge - this one really depends on what you wish to hack; but the more you know about your target, the easier your job will be. E.g. if you wish to reverse engineer software, then knowledge of assembly language is needed. Legal Knowledge - as hacking is a border line subject it is best to know what you can and cannot do. As a rule of thumb, you can attack your own devices but never anyone elses without prior permission. Starting Hacking As I am a practical learner, I believe the best way to learn is via practicing. A good place to start is by using Try Hack Me and I plan to release walkthroughs to some of the levels.
