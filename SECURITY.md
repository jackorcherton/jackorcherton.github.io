As a cybersecurity student, I appreciate open-source security reporting and research, however I forbid any penetration testing whatsoever to be performed on the 'live' version of the website hosted on https://jackorcherton.github.io. This is because it is hosted using third party servers, which may prosecute you for doing so, and I want as close to 100% uptime as possible.

With that being said, I am more than happy for anyone to inspect the code hosted in this repository and report any errors found (see below).

If you wish to test the live website, then there are two branches that you may need/wish to inspect

- Main - this contains all the documentation before being compiled by Hugo.
- gh-pages - this is what is actually hosted on the website.

With that being said please be respectful to any third party integrations that I include (such as Telegram Comments) and abide by their own security policies.

Please note, **that I accept no responsibility for any actions you may take and that it is ultimately up to you to follow all relevant local laws**.

Upon discovery of a flaw, please responsibly disclose by contacting me using one of the social links on the main homepage; contact via telegram would be preferable.

After the flaw is fixed, you will be more than welcome to publish you findings, and I will credit you below.

Thanks,

Jack
