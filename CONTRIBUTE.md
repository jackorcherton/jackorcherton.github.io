As this is a website of my personal views, sadly there isn't much to contribute to.

However, after saying that if you notice a spelling/grammar mistake please let me know by raising a GitHub issue (or by forking the repository). If I am slow to respond, feel free to give me a nudge on one of my social media links listed on my [homepage](https://jackorcherton.github.io).

If you would also like to suggest a topic for me to talk about, please either create a GitHub issue or message me using a method above.

Thanks in advance,

Jack
