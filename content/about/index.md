## Comsec
In my spare time, I help to lead an ethical hacking club, in which we organise discussions, in-house tournaments and teach hacking concepts.

One example of this, is I have recently organised an in-house capture the flag tournament for the second year in a row, based on the twelve days of Christmas. This time I focused on the topics of basic steganography, opensource intelligence and cryptography.

We have also competed competitively, like the Reply Challenge CTF, where we achieved 290 out of 2247.
