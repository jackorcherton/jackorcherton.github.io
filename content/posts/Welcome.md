Hello and welcome to my new website, I hope to use it as an online CV and a place to talk about cybersecurity and ethical hacking/university related topics.

```py
print("Hello World!")
```

Due to this, I ask that you ensure that if you follow any of my posts related to hacking you are doing it on your own equipment or equipment that you have prior permission to hack.

All activities I complete are legal under UK law (as long as you follow the above paragraph), however I am not a lawyer and hence accept no responsibility for anything you do! Laws may also be different in other countries.

Hope to post more soon!

Jack
